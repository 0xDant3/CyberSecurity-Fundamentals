==`Enumeration is collecting as much information as possible. The more information we have, the easier it will be for us to find vectors of attack.`==
It's not hard to get access to the target system once we know how to do it. Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the following two points:
- `Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information.`
- `Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.`
==`Enumeration is the key`==
==`Manual enumeration`== is a ==`critical`== component.

## Introduction to Nmap
- Network Mapper (`Nmap`) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool.
-  It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts.
- Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:
   - Host discovery
   - Port scanning
   - Service enumeration and detection
   - OS detection
   - Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)
- Syntax:
``` shell-session
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```
