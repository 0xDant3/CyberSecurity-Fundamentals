- For us, it is essential to determine the application and its version as accurately as possible. We can use this information to scan for known vulnerabilities and analyze the source code for that version if we find it.
- We can also increase the `verbosity level` (`-v` / `-vv`), which will show us the open ports directly when `Nmap` detects them.
