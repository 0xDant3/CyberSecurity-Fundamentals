- By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`).
- To scan top 10 TCP ports: ![Pasted image 20231106150600](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e52fcd2-dc0a-4131-ab91-6bbb0b70dbc4)
- To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).
- The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed.![Pasted image 20231106151008](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31f363d1-d66a-4db5-bb45-a26576423bb7)

-->Connect scan can bypass the firewall and accurately determine the state of the target ports.
- Tp scan a UDP port we use: `-sU`.
- Another handy method for scanning ports is the `-sV` option which is used to get additional available information from the open ports. This method can identify versions, service names, ==host name== and details about our target.
