- Scanning performance plays a significant role when we need to scan an extensive network or are dealing with low network bandwidth. We can use various options to tell `Nmap` how fast (`-T <0-5>`), with which frequency (`--min-parallelism <number>`), which timeouts (`--max-rtt-timeout <time>`) the test packets should have, how many packets should be sent simultaneously (`--min-rate <number>`), and with the number of retries (`--max-retries <number>`) for the scanned ports the targets should be scanned.
- #### Max Retries:
  Another way to increase the scans' speed is to specify the retry rate of the sent packets (`--max-retries`). The default value for the retry rate is `10`, so if `Nmap` does not receive a response for a port, it will not send any more packets to the port and will be skipped.
  1. Default Scan
 ```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
```
  2. Reduced Retries
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l
```

- #### Rates
   1. Default Scan
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 29.83 seconds
```
   2. Optimized Scan
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.minrate300 --min-rate 300

<SNIP>
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (10 hosts up) scanned in 8.67 seconds
```

Default Scan - Found Open Ports
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```
Optimized Scan - Found Open Ports
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ cat tnet.minrate300 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

23
```
