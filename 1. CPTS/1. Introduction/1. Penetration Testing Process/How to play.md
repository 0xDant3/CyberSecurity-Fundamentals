## Practicing Steps

Think about the skills you have gained and what interests you the most from them. From there, we can pick out a few more modules to increase our knowledge, machines to practice on, and Prolabs or Endgames to really put ourselves to the test. The numbers below are a good starting example:
- 2x Modules 
- 3x Retired Machines 
- 5x Active Machines 
- 1x Pro Lab / Endgame 

| **Step** | **Task**                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.       | Read the module                                       |
| 2.       | Practice the exercises                                |
| 3.       | Complete the module                                   |
| 4.       | Start the module exercises from scratch               |
| 5.       | While solving the exercises again, take notes         |
| 6.       | Create technical documentation based on the notes     |
| 7.       | Create non-technical documentation based on the notes |
## Retired Machines 

When we have completed (at least) two modules and are satisfied with our notes and documentation, we can select three different retired machines. These should also differ in difficulty, but we recommend choosing `two easy` and `one medium` machines. At the end of each module, you will find recommended retired machines to consider that will help you practice the specific tools and topics covered in the module.

|---|---|
|1.|Get the user flag on your own|
|2.|Get the root flag on your own|
|3.|Write your technical documentation|
|4.|Write your non-technical documentation|
|5.|Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up if you don't have a VIP subscription|
|6.|Create a list of information you have missed|
|7.|Watch [Ippsec's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) walkthrough and compare it with your notes|
|8.|Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts|
