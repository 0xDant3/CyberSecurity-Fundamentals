Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our `Nmap` scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits.
There are many ways:
1. Searching on Google name of service + exploit
2. A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`. To install it, we use:
```shell
sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```
We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/).

## Metasploit Primer
The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets.
Once we have `Metasploit` running, we can search for our target application with the `search exploit` command. Example:
```shell
msf6 > search exploit eternalblue
```
`RHOSTS`, which means the IP of our target. Meanwhile, `LHOST`, represents the IP of our attack host.

There are many retired boxes on the Hack The Box platform that are great for practicing Metasploit. Some of these include, but not limited to:
- Granny/Grandpa
- Jerry
- Blue
- Lame
- Optimum
- Legacy
- Devel
