To gain full access, we will need to find an internal/local vulnerability that would escalate our privileges to the `root` user on `Linux` or the `administrator`/`SYSTEM` user on `Windows`.
One excellent resource is [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/), which has an excellent checklist for both [Linux](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist) and [Windows](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/checklist-windows-privilege-escalation) local privilege escalation. Another excellent repository is [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), which also has checklists for both [Linux](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Linux%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md).

We can run many scripts to automatically enumerate the server by running common commands that return any interesting findings. Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS).

Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite)

#### kernel Exploit
When we get the kernel version, we can see if its version is deprecated or updated; if it is te case we go search for some specific Kernel exploit.

#### Vulnerable Software
Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the `dpkg -l` command on Linux or look at `C:\Program Files` in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software.

#### User Privileges
Some users can run some commands with **root** privileges, and with that we can get advantage of it to escalate to **root** user.
Common ways to exploit certain user privileges:
1. Sudo
2. SUID
3. Windows Token Privileges

Once we find a particular application we can run with `sudo`, we can look for ways to exploit it to get a shell as the root user. [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) contains a list of commands and how they can be exploited through `sudo`.

[LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#) also contains a list of Windows applications which we may be able to leverage to perform certain functions, like downloading files or executing commands in the context of a privileged user.

#### Scheduled Tasks
In both Linux and Windows, there are methods to have scripts run at specific intervals to carry out a task.
There are usually two ways to take advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges:
1. Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
2. Trick them to execute a malicious software

The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. In Linux, a common form of maintaining scheduled tasks is through `Cron Jobs`. There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the `write` permissions over them. These include:
1. `/etc/crontab`
2. `/etc/cron.d`
3. `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`

#### Exposed Credentials
Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. This is very common with `configuration` files, `log` files, and user history files (`bash_history` in Linux and `PSReadLine` in Windows).

#### SSH Keys
SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a way to securely log in to a server without needing a password. They work like a lock and key system:
- **Public Key**: This is like a lock you give to the server. The server holds onto this.
- **Private Key**: This is like a key you keep on your own machine. You use this to "unlock" access to the server.
If the server has your public key and you have the matching private key, you can log in without needing to type a password.
#### Key Files and Permissions
On a Linux system, SSH keys for each user are usually stored in a hidden folder called `.ssh` in that user’s home directory, for example:
- `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` — where the private key is stored.
- `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys` — where the public keys of people allowed to log in as this user are stored.
**Important**: Private keys are sensitive. They need to have strict permissions (like `chmod 600`), meaning only the owner can read them. If anyone else can read your private key, it could be misused to access the server.
If you can access someone else's private key file (for instance, `id_rsa`), you can:
1. Copy it to your own computer.
2. Use it with the `-i` flag in the `ssh` command to log into their account on the server.
```bash
ssh root@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
```
#### Adding Your Own Key to Gain Access
If you can write into another user’s `.ssh` directory (like `/home/user/.ssh/`), you can add your **own public key** to their `authorized_keys` file. This file lists all the public keys that are allowed to log in as that user.
Here's how you do it:
1. First, create a new key pair with `ssh-keygen`. This will create two files: a private key (`key`) and a public key (`key.pub`).
2. Copy the content of `key.pub` to the `authorized_keys` file of the target user on the remote machine:
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB... your_key_content ...M= user@machine" >> /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
````
Now you can use your private key (`key`) to log in to that user’s account on the remote server.
```bash
ssh user@remotehost -i key
```
