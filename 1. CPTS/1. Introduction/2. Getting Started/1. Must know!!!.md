## Shell
We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system). This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access (typically `bash` or `sh`) and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged in to the host.
There are three main types of shell connections:

| **Shell Type**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reverse shell` | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Bind shell`    | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Web shell`     | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command. |

## Ports
A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types. Each port is assigned a number, and many are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run on a non-standard port).

There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  `TCP` is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. `UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model.
There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` different `UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:

|Port(s)|Protocol|
|---|---|
|`20`/`21` (TCP)|`FTP`|
|`22` (TCP)|`SSH`|
|`23` (TCP)|`Telnet`|
|`25` (TCP)|`SMTP`|
|`80` (TCP)|`HTTP`|
|`161` (TCP/UDP)|`SNMP`|
|`389` (TCP/UDP)|`LDAP`|
|`443` (TCP)|`SSL`/`TLS` (`HTTPS`)|
|`445` (TCP)|`SMB`|
|`3389` (TCP)|`RDP`|
Guides such as [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf) are great resources for learning standard and less common TCP and UDP ports.

## Web Server
A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser.
